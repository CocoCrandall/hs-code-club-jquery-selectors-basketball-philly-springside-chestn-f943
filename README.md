# jQuery is for BALLERS

jQuery is an amazing language that let's us add tremendous power to our websites through animations. You can make elements move around the page, menus slide in an out, objects disappear from the page. The options are as endless as your creativity. 

In fact, jQuery so so widely used that 54% of the top 10,000 sites and 75% of the top 100 sites in the world use jQuery. That means that basically every site you look at uses jQuery. And where did jQuery come from? It was developed by a 20 year old college student. 

Curious about sites that use jQuery: [Pinterest](http://www.pinterest.com), [ESPN](http://www.espn.com), [Reddit](http://www.reddit.com), [Etsy](http://www.etsy.com), [Instagram](http://www.instagram.com), [Huffington Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com), and the list goes on.

Because jQuery is for BALLERS, you're about to become a jQuery BasketBALLER.

## Let's Get Started

### Step 1:

Click `Open` at the top of this page to bring this lesson down so you can edit files in Nitrous.

### Step 2: 

Take a look at the files in this directory. Some of the files should look familiar. But some of them might look strange.

Notice we have a directory called  `js`, and inside of that directory, a file called `shooting.js`. Just like we wrote our HTML and CSS in different files, we also write our jQuery in different files. The `js` stands for JavaScript. jQuery is technically a JavaScript library (an enhancement to JavaScript), but for now we're just worrying about jQuery. `js/shooting.js` is where you'll be coding your solutions.

### Step 3:

Take a look at `index.html` in the Nitrous text editor. Scroll down to right before the closing `</body>` tag. You'll see something new.

```html
<script src="http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
  <script src="js/shooting.js"></script>
```

This is the JS equivalent of the `link` tag to link your CSS. We put this at the bottom of the page before the closing `body` tag because we don't want animations to start running before the text and images have loaded on the page!

### Step 4:

Open `index.html` in the browser by running in terminal `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 3000`. 

Once you have the server running, select `preview` and then `port 3000`.

You should see a page with a basketball hoop and 4 balls: a basketball, a bowling ball, a beach ball, and a tennis ball. Your goal is to get the balls through the hoop by writing some jQuery.


### Step 5:

Open up
